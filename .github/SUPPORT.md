# Have a bug to report or a feature request?

If you think you have found a bug in ScratchBuffer or you have an idea for a
new feature, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/STealthy-and-haSTy/ScratchBuffer/issues)
on the issue tracker to let us know.

When reporting bugs, it helps to know what version of Sublime Text you're
using, what operating system you're on, and what version of ScratchBuffer you
are using.

You can determine the version of Sublime Text you're using via the `About`
command in the command palette. `Package Control: List Packages` will tell you
what version of ScratchBuffer you're running.
